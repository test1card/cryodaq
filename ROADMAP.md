# CryoDAQ — Feature Roadmap

> **Living document.** Updated 2026-07-08 after v0.64.0. `CHANGELOG.md`
> is the authoritative shipped-history record; this file is only the forward
> feature map.
>
> **Current frontier:** v0.64.0 is shipped from master `67b6301`, and the
> release train v0.58.0 -> v0.64.0 closed the v0.60 Known Limitations backlog.
> The next milestone is hardware lab verification via
> `docs/lab_verification_checklist.md`, not a new code batch.

## Status key

- ✅ **DONE** — shipped and working
- 🔧 **PARTIAL** — useful code exists, but named scope is not fully shipped
- ⬜ **NOT STARTED** — no committed implementation for the named scope
- 🔬 **RESEARCH** — methodology / physics work required before code
- ❌ **RETIRED** — intentionally superseded or folded into another feature

## Release train since v0.51.0

- **v0.52.0-v0.52.2:** F-P1/F-P2/F-P3 prediction overlays shipped on the
  Analytics tab; cooldown predictor floor became data-driven for the real
  quasi-stationary base.
- **v0.53.x:** replay mode and replay predictor bootstrap shipped.
- **v0.54.0-v0.55.x:** F31-F34, MultiLine continuous/burst path, channel
  landmarks, legacy replay maps, knowledge-base indexing, PDF/manual loaders,
  GUI overlay lifecycle fixes, and source-label hardening shipped.
- **v0.57.0-v0.60.0:** fail-closed safety edges, REST/IPC hardening,
  NaN-doctrine, authenticated REST writes, path jail, ZMQ size caps, and
  requirements-lock drift gate shipped.
- **v0.61.0-v0.64.0:** cold rotation and hot+cold reads completed,
  TSP watchdog modes (`off | best_effort | required`) shipped, SQLite
  self-heal landed, verified-off discipline closed, and retention no longer
  starves rotation.

The old v0.60 Known Limitations backlog is closed by v0.61.0-v0.64.0:
historical readers now go through the archive layer, cold rotation is enabled
by default, replay/export/calibration/report paths see rotated days, and the
retention/rotation lifecycle bug is fixed.

## Current milestone

No release-blocking feature batch is queued.

The remaining milestone is hardware lab verification:

1. SQLite shim and startup gate on the laboratory Ubuntu PC.
2. H5 / ZMQ idle-death check on the current laboratory PC.
3. LakeShore runtime calibration on real hardware.
4. Keithley TSP watchdog armed-mode pass on dummy load only.
5. Windows frozen-build smoke (`install.bat`, shortcut, launcher).

Use `docs/lab_verification_checklist.md` as the turnkey protocol.

## Deferred feature work

- **F8 — Cooldown ML prediction upgrade.** Still research-gated: dataset
  curation, model evaluation, and uncertainty methodology come before code.
- **F12 — Experiment templates UI editor.** Nice-to-have operator workflow;
  not a safety or release blocker.
- **F14 — Remote command approval.** Safety-sensitive; needs a fresh threat
  model and explicit go/no-go before implementation.
- **F15 — Linux packaging.** Deployment convenience after lab verification.
- **F16 — Plugin SDK/examples.** Documentation/examples work, not core runtime.
- **F18 — CI/CD residuals.** Matrix and green full suite are done; coverage
  publishing, release automation, and binary artifacts remain optional.
- **F-Y — Diagnostic mode rework.** Re-spec only if lab operation produces
  concrete diagnostic decisions that the current alarm/overlay path cannot
  support.
